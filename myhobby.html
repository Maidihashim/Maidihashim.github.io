	This is my first hobby, fishing. I love fishing. Sometime I wil go fishing with my friends at the <i>Sungai Merbok</i>. Sometime we will go to the ditch near 	to the paddy field to fish. If we go fish at the ditch, the fish that we will get is tilapia, climbing perch, snakehead fish and catfish.

	This is one of my hobbies. This picture I screenshot it from the game I played, Genshin Impact. I always play the game if I have some free time. I love this 		game because it has the charm that the other game doesn't have. It also has a beautiful graphic and storytelling that make my interest to this game doesn't 		dissapear.

	My next hobby is watching anime. My favourite anime is Naruto and Tokyo Ghoul series. I watch the anime when I have some free time. For now I just watch some 	ongoing anime like Spy x Family Part 2, My Hero Academia Season 6 and One Piece.
